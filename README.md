# Python PAA Profile ML Walkthrough

There are many options for running Python interpreters on your computer. For the purposes of this walkthrough, we recommend using Anaconda. Because installation instructions are among the things that change most often in software development, we're not going to provide instructions on how to download and install Anaconda. However, the link for downloading the installation package at the time of this writing is provided below. <br/>

Anaconda comes with a graphic user interface (GUI) and a command line interface (CLI). 

Create virtual anaconda environment:<br/>
`conda create --name paa_env python=3.6`

Activate environment<br/>
`conda activate paa_env`

Install required packages<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Start jupyter lab in command shell:<br/>
`jupyter lab`

A browser should open up with Jupyter Lab and you can run the scripts.<br/>

Happy coding!
